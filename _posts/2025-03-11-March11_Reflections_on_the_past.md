## Reflection on LLM Study (April 23rd, 2023 - July 8th, 2023)

Looking back on my study of Large Language Models (LLMs) that spanned from April 23rd, 2023 to July 8th, 2023, I have several reflections:

### My Thoughts on Aborting the LLM Study Blog

- **Ashamed**: I feel ashamed for not continuing with my blog during this period.
- **Regret Not Keeping the Vibe**: I regret not maintaining the momentum and consistency of my blog.
- **Urged to Keep My Work Going**: Despite the setbacks, I feel a strong urge to continue my work and keep writing no matter what happens.

These reflections help me understand the importance of consistency and perseverance in my work and blogging journey.
