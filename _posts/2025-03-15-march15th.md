# Notes for March 15th

- Successfully set up ComfyUI and downloaded the FLUX.1 dev model.
- Learned that the TypeScript backend interpreter has switched to Go.
- Started learning Go with the `o3-mini-high` project, using the VSCI OpenAI extension in VS Code to make progress toward Example 2.

## Errors Encountered
- The FLUX.1 dev model did not work as expected in my ComfyUI workflow.
